            <h2>Web Development Technology stack: </h2> 
            <p> In website and web app development, there is usually the client-side (front-end) and server-side 
                (back-end) parts of a tech stack.<br> Here is a basic presentation of these two sides workflow: </p>

            <img src="/Images/Stack Types.jpg" width="70%" height="70%">

                <p>Each web app consists of layers that are built atop the one below, forming a stack. Because of this, 
                    the components of the stack<br> are extremely interdependent.
                    You can create your web application from a variety of tools, frameworks, and programming languages.<br>
                    But now, there is such a wide choice that it can be difficult to define what is perfect for your idea.</p>
                
            <h2>Front-end development Technology stack:</h2>
            <p> Front-end, e.g., from client-side web development, refers to everything users see on their screens.<br>
                 According to Statista, as of 2021, JavaScript and HTML/CSS were the most commonly used programming <br>
                 languages among software developers worldwide. Nearly 65 percent of respondents used JavaScript, and <br>
                 just over 56 percent used HTML/CSS. </p>

                 <ul>
                     <li><u><b>HTML, e.g.,</b></u> Hypertext Markup Language is a standardized system used for tagging
                         text files on World Wide Web pages.<br> It is used to input font type, color, graphics, and
                          hyperlink effects.It describes the structure of Web pages using markup.</li>
                    <li><u><b>CSS </b></u> means Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language that describes how the 
                        document written in <br>HTML will be displayed on the users' screens. As the name implies, 
                        it is useful for styling the outlook<br> of a markup text. CSS can reflect HTML code applying 
                        easily different fonts, sizes, colors, formats. </li>
                    <li><u><b>JavaScript </b></u> JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to create
                         interactive effects 
                   within web browsers. <br> With JavaScript code, HTML web pages can become interactive and even 
                    personalized for each user.  </li>
</ul>                                       
           <img src="/Images/front-end-development.svg" class="center1" >
                        <h2>Javascript frameworks</h2> 
                   <p>JavaScript frameworks make the JS code easier to use and make development faster. There are many Js frameworks.
                     The developer can use any framework depending on the requirements:
                   <ul>
                       <li>Angular Js</li>
                       <li>ReactJS</li>
                   </ul> </p>

                   <img  src="/Images/front end framworks.png" class="center1" >
                    
                   <h2>Back-end development technology stack:</h2>
                    <p> Now, in the case of the back-end or server-side development stack, there is a lot more.<br>
                         It consists of the entire business logic of your product work. The back-end executes CRUD <br>
                         operations,an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Demand operations.  </p>
                        <p> The back-end development would include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The operating system of the development process</li>
                            <li>Web server setup</li>
                            <li>Database storage setup</li>
                            <li>The programming language used</li>
                            <li>Web development framework for faster and easier development</li>
                        </ul>
 
        <p>In back-end technology, there are many programming languages. <br>Those most commonly used are:</p>
        <img src="/Images/technology-stack-diagram.jpg" class="center1" >       
        <h2>Database:</h2>
        <p> Your web application needs a place to store its data, and that
             what a <b>database</b> is used for.<br> There are two types of databases: 
             <b>relational and non-relational</b> (the latter being subdivided into
              several categories),<br> each having its pros and cons. Here are 
              the most common databases for web development: </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>MySQL (relational)</li>
                  <li>PostgreSQL (relational)</li>
                  <li>MongoDB (non-relational, document)</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Server:</h2>
              <p> Finally, a web application needs a server to handle requests from 
                  clients computers. <br>There are two major players in this domain:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Apache</li>
                      <li>Nginx</li>
                  </ul>

        <h2> MEAN stack: </h2>
                 <p> The MEAN stack consists of MongoDB, express.js, angular.js, and node.js.
                     It is more of a full-stack structure.<br>
                     It is an open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic websites and web applications. </p>
             <img src="/Images/mean stack.png" class="center1" >

        <h2> MERN Stack: </h2>
                 <p> The MERN stack consists, MongoDB, Express, React/Redux, and Node.js. The MERN stack is very similar<br>
                     to the MEAN stack. It is used because of the growth of popularity of ReactJS in front-end development<br>
                     and NodeJS in back-end development, and it is useful for building high-end single-page applications,<br>
                      like the Plaid app. </p>
            <img src="/Images/mern stack.png" class="center1" >
